# seq2seqTextClassification

#In this Deep Learning Project, we will use the customer complaints data about consumer financial products to build multi-class text classification models using RNN and LSTM.

Problem Overview

Text Classification is one of the essential applications of Natural Language Processing. Neural network-based methods have obtained significant progress on various natural language processing tasks. As deep learning is emerging, training complex data has become faster and easier with networks like RNNs and LSTM.

In the previous projects, we have witnessed how to use the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm for text classification, and we have also implemented the skip-gram model for word embeddings. This project will see how to implement the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for text classification.

 

 

Aim

To perform text classification on the dataset using RNN and LSTM models.

 

 

Data Description

The dataset contains more than two million customer complaints about consumer financial products. Amongst the various available columns, we have a column that contains the actual text of the complaint and one column containing the product for which the customer is raising the complaint.
